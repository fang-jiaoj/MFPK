![framework](images/workflow.png)
MFPK is a multi-fidelity transfer-learning framework for predicting intravenous PK parameters across multiple species, including humans, dogs, monkeys, rats and mice. It incorporates graph-based, motif-based, and three-dimensional structure-based molecular representations to capture comprehensive, multi-scale chemical information.
